### CPSC 120

 
* [Lab 3](https://github.com/cpsc-pilot-fall-2022/cpsc-120-lab-03-Tofutom/tree/master/part-3) Part 3 was one of my most favorite since it was the start of our 16-week journey. I was very curious about how coding worked and I had no idea how to code inputs and outputs along with if statements. I enjoyed coding cin and cout because the result prompted interactions between the computer and the person. With that being said, I also liked the creation of conditions such as the if and else if statements. I was excited about this program since it was the first guessing game that I have created. This experience has taught me the usage of basic coding funcitons.Finally, the learning objective for this reflection was the learning of cin, cout, and else if statements.

* [Lab 5](https://github.com/cpsc-pilot-fall-2022/cpsc-120-lab-05-joselynn-tom/tree/master/part-1) Part 1 was another favorite because I was learning how to use vectors. I was able to learn a few things from this lab. The first was how to store elements into a vector and how to use its size as a condition. After making the first sandwich program, I always wondered if there was another way. This vector approach made me realize how important vectors were. Furthermore, the objective of this lab was to get familiar with how vectors are formed and used.

* [Lab 6](https://github.com/cpsc-pilot-fall-2022/cpsc-120-lab-06-tomphaeton-phu-and-joselynn-troncoso/tree/main/part-1) Part 1 a favorite because of the learning of loops. I liked this lab because we were able to make use of a loop to create a specific pattern for the assignment. I was curious about how to make a specific pattern without cout(s). Instead of using cout(s) continuously, we made a more simple program with just a loop and few conditions. This lab has taught me the value of loops and how it can be used for many different taks. The learning objective of this lab was to understand the use of a loop and how to use it in different ways.
